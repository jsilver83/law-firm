== Capability Name (real meaningful name of the capability)

[horizontal]
Capability ID::	A unique ID to track capabilities.

Use case #::	Use cases that satisfy this capability.  The capability should trace forward to this list of use cases once they are identified.

Description::	Brief on the intention of the capability.

Rationale::	A justification of the capability.

Source::	Source of the need.

Fit Criteria::	A measurement of the capability such that it is possible to test if the solution matches the original capability.  The fit criteria represent the requirements definition.  They mainly enumerate the functionalities, along with the applicable constraints, provided by the capability.  Use cases should be traceable backward to these functionalities.  Each fit criterion should have a number.

Dependencies::	A list of all other capabilities that have some dependency on this one and vice versa.

Conflicts::	Other capabilities that cannot be implemented if this one is.
Supporting Materials:	Pointer to documents that illustrate and explain this capability.

Priority::	An indication of the priority of the capabilities after taking into account all factors such as customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction, user groups priority, risk, cost, implementation effort, etc. A scale of 1 to 5, 5 being highest priority.

Risk::	A scale of 1 to 5, along with a description, to indicate the risk of implementing this capability, with 5 being the most risky.
